As long as your development code is stored in `/src` within the polybox, it will be remounted during new polybox sessions and your code is safe.\r\n\r\n## How to donate a polybox!\r\n\r\n**PLEASE** Add your favourite dev environment!\r\n\r\n- Fork this project & branch\r\n- Create a docker image (keep it small please) and push it to a public repo\r\n- Add a polybox file in the `./boxes` directory, see the current `./boxes/rails4` as an example.\r\n\r\n### Wishlist boxes\r\n\r\n- Nodejs\r\n- Go\r\n- Haskell\r\n- Scala","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
